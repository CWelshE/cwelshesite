I don't think there needs to be a very interesting initial post in a
blog. I treat it like initializing a git repository: probably, nobody
will read it.

In case you do happen to be here, though, welcome to my infinitessimally
small part of the Web. May you be granted all manner of information
security, compassion, and knowledge.

Maybe I can even help with that last bit.

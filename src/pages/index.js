    <h1>Hi. I&apos;m Cody.</h1>
    <p>
      My main passion is software engineering. Right now, I work on websites,
      experiments, procedural art, and all manner of applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      My tools of choice include (but are certainly not limited to): (P)React,
      Redux (when necessary), PostgreSQL, Webpack, moral support from my cat, an
      obsession with Vim, and whatever &quot;gets the job done.&quot;
